More detail to follow, but for now use the following pointers:

 - [Standard Symfony app install guide](http://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment.html)
 - The included [Dockerfile](https://github.com/parsingphase/takeAticket/blob/master/Dockerfile) contains full steps for manual installation
 - A partial [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) build script exists in [build.xml](https://github.com/parsingphase/takeAticket/blob/master/build.xml) - run `ant deploy-current`
