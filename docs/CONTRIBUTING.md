Contributing
============

Code must pass existing tests (including linting, formatting etc) and others that may be added (eg, jshint is to be added).

Recommended IDE is PHPStorm but any may be used so long as tests pass.

Please add an issue on GitHub for any TODO task you start.

This project is intended to run with the absolute minimum of dependencies, except:

* PHP 5.5+
* Composer
* sqlite3

so that it can be run from most Linux or OSX desktop environments without server configuration / further installs being needed.

In particular, npm or ant should not currently be assumed to be available.

Please discuss before adding any further requirements, or adding any further dependencies via composer.
